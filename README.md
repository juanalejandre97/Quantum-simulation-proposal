# Quantum-simulation-proposal
 Proposal of a 3 qubits reconfigurable quantum gate that I developed for my TFG (Bachelor Thesis).
 In first place, you can find my TFG (Bachelor thesis) document and a python (Qiskit) file which holds the code associated to the circuit proposed.
 In addition, I have included the results of the performance of a real quantum simulation of my circuit through a quantum processor. This task has been
 accomplished getting access remotely to the 5 qubits quantum processor ibmq_belem.
